Overview
The Giyapay QR Payment System is designed to provide businesses with an easy-to-use QR code-based payment system.

Customers can scan these codes to make payments under the Giyapay system.

This system ensures:

Efficient payment flow for businesses and their customers.
Role-based administration for better control over the creation and usage of QR codes.
A secure, scalable, and modern payment processing system.
